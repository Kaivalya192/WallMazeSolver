# Wall Maze Solver with PID Algorithm

This project is a wall maze solver implemented using an Arduino board and a PID algorithm. The goal is to navigate through a maze by following the walls while avoiding collisions.

## Description

The wall maze solver utilizes sensors to detect walls and navigate through the maze autonomously. The PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) algorithm is employed to adjust the motion of the robot based on the feedback from the sensors, allowing for smooth and efficient navigation.
